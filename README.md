## 🔮 Overview

**Poselius Trident** is built as a fast, reliable computational layer designed to process large volumes of data in real-time. By integrating an advanced inference engine, Trident evaluates signals, identifies irregular patterns, and initiates autonomous responses based on predefined operational policies.

It is designed for infrastructure that requires **zero-latency decision making** and **self-healing capabilities**.

## ⚡ Key Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Continuous monitoring of system behavior to identify outliers and irregular patterns instantly. |
| **Autonomous Decisions** | Responds to issues automatically using policy-based actions and conditional workflows without human intervention. |
| **Resilience** | Features self-monitoring, automatic failover, and integrity checks to ensure 99.97% uptime. |
| **High Performance** | Targeted decision time of **< 25ms** with detection accuracy ranging between **94–99%**. |
| **Security** | Encrypted communication, strict access controls, and immutable logging for audit trails. |
